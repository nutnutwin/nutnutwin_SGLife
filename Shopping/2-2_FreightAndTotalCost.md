# EMS recommended

    It's strongly suggested that products get delivered to SGD by EMS, the rationale being

- Par Avion(By Air) allows tax free import to SG, while By Sea is not included
- one delivery cannot exceed 400SGD(products, delivery, insurance, all included)
- By Air is simply faster(3-4 days vs 15days+)
- should not deliver more than 3kg each package
- dont include liquid/alcohol/glass bottles(especially cosmetics)


# Freight cost

- first 1kg can be pricy, like 3600JPY(30SGD+), after that,
- each kg costs around 1,200(10SGD+)
- so the sweet point is around 2.5 to 3.5kg

once you reach 1kg, each 100gram cost around 1SGD(1kg for 10SGD)


# Total cost
