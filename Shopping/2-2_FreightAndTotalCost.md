# Freight



### EMS recommended(Best practice)

    It's strongly suggested that products get delivered to SGD by EMS, the rationale being

- Par Avion(By Air) allows tax free import to SG, while By Sea is not included
- one delivery cannot exceed 400SGD(products, delivery, insurance, all included)
- By Air is simply faster(3-4 days vs 15days+)
- should not deliver more than 3kg each package
- dont include liquid/alcohol/glass bottles(especially cosmetics)
- do not buy too many of each items(might get stopped by custom, deemed as commercial )



### Freight cost

- first 1kg can be pricy, like 3600JPY(30SGD+), after that,
- each kg costs around 1,200(10SGD+)
- so the sweet point is around 2.5 to 3.5kg

once you reach 1kg, each 100gram cost around 1SGD(1kg for 10SGD)


# Total cost 

if already above 1kg

### per piece

we transport ｢Kobayashi Floss｣ which

- price diff is 9SGD per piece(5 vs 14)
- each weigh around 50gram(which translate into 0.5SGD freight)
- the total cost of buying from JP would be 5.5 vs 14
- saving you at least 8SGD per piece


### multiple items

- 1kg of 20 such items(strongly not recommended❗)
- price difference is ★80 SGD
- one shipment would save you 160-240 SGD, if planned properly
