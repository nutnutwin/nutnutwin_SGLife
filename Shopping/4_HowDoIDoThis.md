# Where should I buy ? 

- Amazon JP
- Yodobashi (no longer recommended, they might cancel your order if your address is relay company)
- Biccamera (might work )


# Relay company 

- I am using DANKEBOX(not necessary if you live abroad, I use it for mail reception)
- Goyokikiya
- Tenso
- and many other sites
- Note: many has limitation like how long they can keep it, or the size...


# The Process

- buy from major EC sites(aforementioned)
- send then to relay company(who would give you a personal address to receive these products)
- once all your deliveries are in the box, schedule a delivery.(and pay for delivery )
- you need to refer to respective sites to be sure.
